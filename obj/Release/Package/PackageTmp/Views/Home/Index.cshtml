    I graduated <a href="http://louisville.edu/speed/alumni-1/kentucky.html">
        CECS at UofL
        in Speed School 2004
    </a>. After I graduated I switched field and pursued healthcare
    field as a Respiratory Therapist. Currently I am working as a therapist.I am currently
    reading over C#, ASP.NET and Java books on my spare time.

    What inspired me in computer was the famous Commodore 64. When I was in middle school,
    I joined commodore 64 club at Beechmont and enjoy using it. That spark my interest
    in becomming a programmer. All my life, computer has been a part of my life.
